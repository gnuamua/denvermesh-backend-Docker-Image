This is the dockerfile for the backend image of the
hoa-colors.com website. These files are required to build the image
so the image can be included in the docker-compose file for the
site.
The site.cfg file is a copy of the buildout.cfg file used in
local development for the plone backend on the local desktop
development environment.
